Frequently Asked Questions/Frequently Posted Inquiries about Vector.

-   The Vector app is giving me an error/I can't access ddl.io/v.
    -   The DDL servers have been down for quite a while now, and it doesn't seem like they'll be going up anytime soon.

-   Is there any way I can set up my Vector?
    -   Yes, with [wire-pod](https://github.com/kercre123/wire-pod), a free and open-source server solution for Vector.

-   This seems too daunting. Is there an easier solution?
    -   Check out [Dee's WirePod Server](https://techshop82.com/shop/wire-pod-server/).
    -   If you read the [Installation guide](https://github.com/kercre123/wire-pod/wiki/Installation), you'll also see that there are easy-to-install releases for Windows, macOS, and Android.

-   Do I need my computer on all the time for Vector to be able to listen to my commands?
    -   Yes.

-   Can I unlock my bot?
    -   At this point, no. You have to pay for an OSKR unlock and DDL has to give it to you. They haven't given one out for a long time.
    -   No one has been able to find a way in via hacking.

-   Does wire-pod work with Vector 2.0?
    -   Yes.

-   What is OSKR? How is an OSKR bot different from a regular bot?
    -   Regular bots (aka. production bots) are what were sold to consumers. By default, you cannot make any edits to the software running on the robot.
    -   OSKR bots are unlocked production bots. OSKR (Open-Source Kit for Robotics) allows any consumer to pay to get their robot unlocked. You cannot buy this at the moment, though. An OSKR unlock gives you root shell access and the ability to modify the filesystem.
    -   Dev bots are bots which have been unlocked by Anki. These are rare and you most likely don't have one. These give the same level of access as OSKR bots.

-   What is escape pod?
    -   Escape pod was a product sold by DDL in case their servers ever went down. You had to buy it in order to use it. WirePod is a free alternative to that.

-   What is the status of Digital Dream Labs?
    -   It is unlikely they'll get their servers back up again. It is clear that they have run into financial trouble and that only a few (one?) employees remain.
